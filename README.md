# Lua-review
My notes for Lua. Intended to be pulled and ran, not very readable from github.
I personally love using replit (powerful and versatile ide in the browser) and I highly recommend using it if you don't already have lua set up.

## Also, I want to give credit to the sources I used to learn nearly everything I put in here:
